# Getting Started

Follow these steps to build and run the app.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- TypeScript

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd simulation_table_analysis
   ```
3. Install and build the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

## Run

To start the application, run:

```sh
npm start
```

## Development

For development purposes, you can use:

```sh

This will start the application with `nodemon`, which will automatically restart the server when changes are detected.
